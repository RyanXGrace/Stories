# Best Worst Day

(An expanded version of a story originally by Jen)

The security agent handed me my papers, phone, and the zip lock bag. I was finally "free" to go catch my flight, but of course, it had left near a half-hour ago.

*I hate this fucking day.*

I was seriously considering crying, but when I checked my texts I felt a huge relief.

>**Leah** `They won't hold the plane any longer`

>**Leah** `But good news! I found a volunteer with an expense card to stay back and help you get your hotel and tickets sorted out!`

>**Leah** `So sorry this happened to you ☹ I'll make it up to you the next shift we have together 😇🍰🍷`

*Thank fucking god.*

>**Unknown** `Hi Jen. I'll be waiting for you in the food court on this side of security. If you don't get through let me know and I'll come to you.`

I didn't even take the time to respond, I just took off towards the food court. I hadn't had more than a cup of water in ten hours. As I neared it, I looked around, hoping that it was Dr. Williams who had stayed behind, because she would be fun to get drunk with.

And then I saw you.

"Fucking that fucking bitch!" I said loud enough to startle the people walking around me. I ducked behind a pillar so you wouldn't see me and opened my phone.

*What a fucking bitch.*

>**Jen** `fuck u leah u ficking piece of shit`

I wanted to write more but I knew she was in the air and I was going to have five hours to come up with more ways to tell her I hate her.

*Worst fucking day of my life and she gets the guy I have a crush on to stay and witness it*

I peeked around the column and saw you scanning the area, looking for me. My stomach growled and I knew I had to bite the bullet, so I stuffed my phone back in my pocket and walked towards you. When you spotted me you smiled that way you do, like you're genuinely happy to see me. It made my stomach do flip flops.

I tried not to look at you as I walked up. I was so embarrassed. And maybe I knew your face would make me feel better and I wanted to stay mad at Leah for just a little while longer.

"Hey, Ryan," I muttered.

"Want to get something to eat?" you asked. 

---

You got us a booth at the back of one of the sit-down restaurants. The waitress followed us over and took our drink order. You got water. I ordered a rum and coke. She looked me once over, a tiny girl wearing sandals, short shorts, and a hoodie. She was going to make me show ID. 

*Fucking goddammit.*

"I'll just need to see your ID," she said sweetly.

Out of my hoodie, I pulled the paper with a printed picture of my passport, and the police report saying that my actual ID was lost and that this was valid ID for ten days.

"I lost my wallet," I said lamely. She looked the papers over and left to get our drinks. I put them away and finally let myself look at you. 

You looked concerned.

"Do you want to talk about what happened?" you asked.

I didn't say anything and buried my face in the menu."How much will the hospital pay for?" I asked.

"Sixty," you said.

The waitress brought our drinks. I downed half of mine and ordered the ribeye. You ordered the same. 

---

"So Leah roped you into being my babysitter?" I asked. My tone was a lot angrier than I wanted it to be, and I hoped you didn't think I was mad at you.

"Uh," you started, caught off guard. "No, not at all. When I heard people saying you were going to miss the flight because you'd lost your things, I asked Leah if you had any way to pay for a hotel or food, and I said I could stay back if you needed it."

You looked so genuine, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if Leah had lied to try and take credit. Maybe it was because I started drinking on an empty stomach, but my insides were all twisted up after hearing that. Or maybe it was because I had started imagining all the ulterior motives you might have had for staying back.

"Do you babysit often?" I asked, and you smiled.

"Off and on ever since I was fourteen. I don't usually let anyone drink rum though. I might get kicked out of the Baby-Sitters Club for this."

I laughed at that, and it seemed to make us both a little more comfortable. You casually looked around the room, watching people, and it felt good that you weren't pressing me about what happened. 

You leaned back and stretched your arms. I let myself stare at the muscles of your chest and shoulders that were only partly hidden under your tight t-shirt. I couldn't stop myself from picturing you bending me over your knee to be spanked.

"Are you seeing someone?" I asked. You looked at me, clearly trying to read my intentions, but even I didn't know what the fuck I was up to. 

"No."

"Does that have anything to do with why you stayed back for me?"

*Oh, shut the fuck up Jen!*

You laughed anxiously. I slipped off my sandal and slowly moved my foot up along the inside of your leg.

"Jen." You almost choked on the word. 

I licked my lips, hoping that the intensity I saw growing on your face was also grow elsewhere on your body.

"Stop that, Jen!" Your words were so deep and sudden and commanding. I snapped my foot back and covered my mouth with my hands. You hadn't moved, but your muscles had tensed. The nervousness on your face had turned into something hard that I couldn't read.

"Yes, Sir!" I squeaked and lowered my eyes to the table. After a moment you let out a breath and I said, "I'm very sorry, Sir. I've been making the wrong decisions all day. I shouldn't have assumed you stayed back for my company."

I tried to sit up straight and folded my hands in my lap. I kept my eyes down and could feel you watching me. 

"Why did you say it like that?" you finally asked.

"What do you mean, Sir?" I squeezed my thighs together to keep my hands from reaching for my pussy.

"What does it mean to you when you say 'Sir' like that?"

My voice trembled as I said, "It's how I, as a Submissive, address my Dominant. I can call you Master if you prefer."

*Please fucking please be ok with this.*

I tried to keep my back straight and my head down, but I hated that I only had a hoodie to wear. I always dressed my best when out with my Dom. Instead, I looked like your bratty daughter. My pussy screamed to be touched as soon as I had that thought.

My phone dinged and I glanced towards you enough to see that you had yours out, and so I pulled out mine.

>**Ryan** `Are you ok?`

>**Jen** `yes`

>**Jen** `I need this pls`

>**Jen** `even if u can give jsut a lil bit`

"If I ask you a question, are you going to tell me the truth?"

"Yes, Sir."

"What happened today?"

"I got ready for the flight early because I wanted to do some work things here at the airport before the flight. I got an uber to come here, but with all the unexpected ice we ended up in a big pileup. I helped another driver who had a four-centimetre unilateral laceration in zone two on the right side of her neck. I was able to hand her off to the paramedics in good condition, and then I gave my statement to the police. But by that time the uber with my carry-on, coat, and wallet had been towed away."

I paused long enough to glance up at you. You were listening so intently, I had to allow myself a small smile. I continued, "They couldn't tell me for sure where it had been towed to. It really was a huge mess. Twelve cars, I think, in total. I got a ride to the police station to get the temporary ID papers so I could make the flight still. I tossed the sweats I was wearing because they were covered in blood, then Leah picked me up and we raced here. She got through security, but they held me back because I made a mistake."

Our food arrived, and you told me to eat first before continuing the story. I'm sure it was obvious how hungry I was. I felt so warm inside that you made it an order, rather than an option.

---

I finished before you, so I asked, "May I continue, Sir?" You nodded. "At security, they gave me a hard time because of the temporary ID, but what caused me to miss the flight was my own fault. I put everything I had into the bin. Sandals, phone, and papers. But I then set off the detector because I had totally forgotten I was wearing this."

Out of the pocket of my hoodie, I pulled a zip lock bag and put it on the table. The large metal anal plug made a loud thump.

I waited to see if you would say anything, but right then the waitress arrived and offered to clear our plates. She stumbled over her words when she saw what was in the bag, but you pulled her attention away by asking for the bill. When she was gone and you turned back to me I was staring at your chest with tears in my eyes. I felt I was about to explode with embarrassment.

"Jen," you said in a comforting voice, "give me your things. I will take care of them. I don't want to risk you losing them."

"Yes, Sir." I handed over my phone and papers, which you pocketed, and then I slid the bag with the anal plug across the table. I looked up enough to meet your gaze and you had the most reassuring smile. I mouthed, "thank you," and found myself smiling back. You tucked the plug into your carry-on.

I stayed at your side while you paid for the meal, and while you got us tickets on tomorrow's flight home. Then, instead of getting a shuttle to a hotel, you took us to a department store so I could get anything I might need. You gave me a time limit, and even set a budget I was to stay under. You followed me and made decisions for me when I could not.

"Show me one of each type," you said when I needed help choosing a pair of panties. I brought an assortment to you, and I squirmed as you considered them. I watched as other shoppers noticed you and checked you out. But while some of them tried to catch your eye, you only paid attention to the panties you were choosing for me. I wished I could show you how wet the ones I was wearing had become.

You chose a pair of black hipsters with purple stripes and a seamless pink thong.

"Thank you, Sir," I said. As I gathered up the rejects you caressed the back of my neck, and I couldn't help but moan. 

---

You took us to a nicer hotel than I expected, and had me wait while you got us each a room. I was very saddened by that news, but I reminded myself to keep my expectations low, and just enjoy your attention while I still had it.

You led us up just two floors and down a long hallway to a tiny room that overlooked the parking lot.

"This is your room," you said and handed me a key card and my bags from the department store. "We will be checking out at ten tomorrow morning, so I expect you to be ready to go when I meet you here at 9:55."

"Yes, Sir," I said, and cringed at the disappointment in my voice.

"I'm going to shower and then find a movie to watch. If you wish to join me for the movie, you can come up to room 1125  in thirty minutes."

I looked up at you but couldn't tell if you were open to negotiating the plan. I decided to take the chance.

"Sir, if it would please you, I could wash you in the shower."

...

Your room was much nicer. A king-size bed, a view over the city, and a bathroom with a shower that could fit four people.

You told me to wash up and then wait for you in the shower, then you pulled out your phone and ignored me.

I rushed to comply, scrubbing the sweat and smell of the day off me. Once ready, I knelt on the shower floor, just outside the stream of water. I faced the entry but kept my eyes lowered so I wouldn't meet your gaze. The air was warm with the humidity, but being out of the water my nipples got rock hard. My pussy leaked its juices onto my legs.

I gasped when you opened the shower door and stepped through the steam. I thought the clothes you wore were meant to highlight your muscles and your size, but seeing you then I knew that they instead downplayed those aspects of your body. 

You were clearly trying not to look at me as you stepped forward and under the spray, so I rose to my feet and moved in behind you. I marvelled at the broad muscles of your shoulders and back. I reached up and ran my hands from your trapezii down to your glutes. Your ass looked downright delicious, but you tensed up so I pulled my hands away. 

You leaned forward against the wall, with the water running down your shoulder and back. I couldn't help but giggle when I realized your head was higher than the showerhead.

I lathered my hands and started washing your shoulders, arms, and back. Then you turned around so I could wash your chest. You stared out above my head, your face showing what could only be anxiety. I didn't understand, but I reminded myself that you were in charge and that if I needed to know something, you would tell me.

I couldn't believe how big you were, and how solid you felt. I imagined myself as a slave girl in charge of bathing Conan, or Thor. I felt such a physical comfort just having you standing next to me. But something had you shaken, and I resolved that I would do everything to let you know you were safe with me.

Your cock clearly didn't have any anxiety of its own as it kept brushing against my stomach while I washed your chest. I knelt down to wash your legs and feet, first front, then back. After pausing a moment to give you an opening if you wanted it, I moved my hands up to wash your ass. You flinched with the first touch, but then you seemed to relax, and even pushed back against my hands as if trying to get more touch.

Finally, I stood and pressed myself against you. I kissed your back and moved my hands around your ribs, then slid them down to your cock. 

I heard a rumble in your chest as you said something, but I didn't hear what it was. You sucked in a breath and said much more clearly, "Careful."

Carefully, I soaped up your rock hard cock. Your whole body twitched and rocked along with the motion of my hands moving up and down your shaft. With my head against your back, I could hear your heart racing, and I felt your cock grow even harder in my hands.

You reached forward to steady yourself, but neither of us noticed that you'd leaned on the hot water tap until the scalding water sent us scampering away.

That definitely put an end to the shower, and I worried that you might send me to my room, but you let me towel you off and dress you in your underwear and a robe. The hotel robe was downright indecent on you, and when you brought your arms forward we both heard the seams splitting. I couldn't help but giggle as I pulled it off you, and you quickly put on a t-shirt and shorts, ignoring my attempts to do it for you.

You went and sat on the couch and turned on the TV. Your face looked even more anxious than in the shower, so I decided to give you a few minutes. I considered joining you wearing nothing since you hadn't told me what to wear, but I thought the middle ground might be better. I put on the new black and purple panties and a cut-off t-shirt. The shirt was as tight as I had hoped, and as I looked myself over I realized that joining you naked would probably be more subtle. I slipped a finger into my pussy and was surprised by how wet I was, even after the setbacks. I wished I could put in my butt plug, but I didn't want to risk derailing the evening any more by asking you for it. I put on a fresh coat of lip gloss and went to join you.

---

You chose a heist thriller. I sat at your feet, and after a few minutes, you moved your leg to press up against me. I ran my hand up and down your calf, caressing the smooth, hard muscle. 

You paused the movie and said, "Jen, go get us both some water."

"Yes, Master!" I hopped to my feet and ran to the kitchenette.

When I came back I knelt between your legs and presented your glass to you. That's when I noticed how hard your cock was under your shorts. You drank the water in one quick, anxious gulp.

"Master," I said, "may I take care of that for you?" I nodded at your tented shorts. You didn't look at me, but you stood and let me remove your shorts and underwear. Your skin felt hot still from the shower, so you pulled off your shirt and sat back down with a glimmer of sweat covering your god-like body.

You cupped my face with one hand before closing your eyes and leaning back. As your hand pulled away I caught it just long enough to suck your thumb into my mouth and give it a hint of what your cock was about to receive. You moaned loudly and a shiver passed through your body.

I ran my hands up your thighs and watched your cock twitch. "Thank you, Master," I said.

Your cock smelled faintly of soap and your sweat. I carefully took hold of the shaft and leaned in, closing my lips around the head of your cock and tasting your pre-cum. I moaned to let you know how delicious you were.

---

I took things slow. I explored your sex, seeing how you responded to each action. I loved making you whimper by flicking the head of your cock with my outstretched tongue. I loved how caressing the inside of your thighs made your cock twitch in my mouth. And I especially loved how you would say my name in a deep, rumbling whisper when I would push forward until your cock entered my throat.

My mouth slowly guided you towards your climax, but just when you got close something changed. Your heart raced faster and faster, but your cock softened in my mouth and hands. I looked up to see your face in a grimace. Your hands clutched the fabric of the cushions. You were trying to force your breaths to be slower and deeper.

I ran my hands along your thighs in time with your breathing, helping you find a slow and steady rhythm. I nuzzled my face into your stomach and whispered to you that you were safe and in control.

Eventually, you calmed down, and then your cock started to harden again. I continued to build up your orgasm, but you got waylaid by panic a second time. I was scared you were going to give up, but we worked through it again, and the third time was the charm.

I swirled my tongue around the head of your cock and fondling your balls when you started humping up into my mouth. I held myself still and sucked hard. You grunted with thrust. You clenched your fists and pressed them down on your thighs as if to hold yourself back. I took hold of your hands and guided them to my head.

*Fucking use me, Master.*

You grabbed me by the hair and pulled me towards you as your cock thrust further and further, until you were forcing your cock down my throat.

You let out a great roar. I pulled away and you released me just in time for the first shot of your cum to hit the bridge of my nose. I jacked your cock fast and aimed your cum across my forehead and cheeks, on my chin and neck. You came so much I laughed in delight. I was completely covered in your hot, sticky cum. As your orgasm died down I nursed on the end of your cock and giggled each time you involuntarily jerked and spasmed. 

When I had sucked out the last of your cum, I released your tired, softening cock. You opened your eyes and looked down at me, and I leaned back so you could see how your cum completely covered my face.

You looked exhausted but relieved. I began scraping your cum into my mouth and giggled when you let out a gasp.

"Stand up," you said, still trying to catch your breath.

I hopped to my feet and clasped my hands behind my back. You sat forward and were somehow the same height as me standing. I stared down at your chest, still glistening with sweat.

"How wet are you, little girl?"

*Fucking soaking wet for you*

"I am soaking wet, Master."

"Slide your fingers into your panties and cum for me."

I barely stopped myself from squealing with excitement. My right hand was fingering my pussy in an instant. The squelch of my juices was obscene, and you seemed to enjoy the sound as your eyes locked on the hidden movements of my hand. I had never masturbated while someone watched before, and it thrilled me to be doing something just for you. 

I switched back and forth between my pussy and my clit. It took less than a minute before I was on the edge of cumming, but your attention felt so good I didn't want it to end. The musky smell of my pussy filled the air, and you took a deep breath through your nose. Your tired cock twitched and started to grow.

*Your body fucking loves your little slave girl.*

You seemed to love every moment of this, and I started to whimper. I wanted so badly to cum for you and fulfill your command, but I also wanted this moment to never end.

You sat up a little straighter and cupped my head in your hands, forcing me to look up to you. "I told you to cum for me," you said. And I did.

"Master! Oh my god!" I cried. A hungry smile spread across your face. My knees buckled and my thighs squeezed tight, as my cum poured out of me. You pulled me forward, lifting me onto your lap effortlessly, and kissed me. I moaned desperately as your tongue sought mine, and I latched onto it, desperate for you to be inside me.

You cradled me as my body shook. I mewled as I sucked on your tongue, and you squeezed my neck. My whole body let go, and you sat back, holding me tight.

---

You let me rinse you off and tuck you into bed. I curled next to you and ran my fingers through your hair. You were so sleepy.

"Master?" I asked, then added, "Ryan?"

You opened your eyes and smiled at me. "Yes?"

"Was this... Are you ok with this? I know it was a stretch for you."

You ran your hand along my side, resting it on my hip. "Yes, Jen. Are you ok with it?"

"Yes, Master," I said, choking up a little. I slid down to lie in the crook of your arm. "This was a wonderful day."

*The best fucking day.*
